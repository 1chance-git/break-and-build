# Break & Build
Building a legacy — one broken app at a time.

## Why
Because learning by breaking things apart and rebuilding them is the fastest path to mastery.
This isn't about perfect code — it's about perfect progress.

## What
- Small projects.
- Break them intentionally.
- Study the break.
- Rebuild better, smarter, faster.
- Document everything.

## How
- Use AI tools like Replit AI, Copilot, Devin, and Cursor.
- Start simple, move systematically.
- Write down what broke, why it broke, and how you rebuilt it stronger.

## First Principle
> "If it doesn’t break, you don’t really understand it."
– Break & Build Philosophy

## This Repo
This will track:
- Break experiments
- Rebuild logs
- Lessons learned
- New tools and methods discovered along the journey.
