# Break & Build - Recursion Reflection

## Aftermath
- How stable is the rebuild?
- Are there hidden weaknesses still?

## Recursive Questioning
- How could I have broken it even worse?
- How would a beginner break it?
- How would a hacker break it?
- How would a future smarter version of me break it?

## New Ideas
- Features or improvements I thought of while breaking/rebuilding:

## Meta Reflection
- What mindset or habit slowed me down?
- What mindset or habit helped me most?
