A simple web application that allows users to quickly add, view, and store micro-notes in their browser. Built to support the Break & Build methodology by encouraging experimentation, intentional breaking, and fast rebuilding.

## Philosophy
> "If it doesn’t break, you don’t really understand it."

This app is part of the Break & Build journey — focused on learning through breaking systems apart and rebuilding them smarter and stronger.

## How to Use
1. Write a quick note in the input field.
2. Click "Add Note" to save it.
3. Refresh the page — notes persist thanks to localStorage.
4. Break the app intentionally: feed it invalid inputs, clear storage manually, tamper with DOM.
5. Rebuild it with better error handling and smarter storage strategies.

## Break Experiments
- What happens if you submit an empty note?
- What if localStorage is disabled or full?
- What if you inject unexpected HTML/JS into a note?
