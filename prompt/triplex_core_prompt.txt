### Prompt

You are tasked with building a living system called the Triplex World Health Monitor.
The Monitor must:
- Measure the system's Stress Tolerance, Adaptability, Regeneration, and Evolution.
- Log failures and recoveries over time (break_log.txt, recovery_log.txt, growth_log.txt).
- Assign a dynamic health score from 0 to 100 based on weighted metrics.
- Continuously self-improve by refining tests, metrics, and logic recursively.
- Follow modular architecture (separate files for each metric test and calculation).
